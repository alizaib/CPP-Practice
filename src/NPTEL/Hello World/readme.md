The first thing in compilation of any C or C++ program is Pre-Processing

- Preprocessor directives are lines in that code that start with a # symbol. These lines are not program statements but directives for the preprocessor.
- The CPP i-e C Preprocessor examine the code before actual compilation and resolve all the directives. 
    - CPP directives extend along single line only
    - If you want to proceed to the new line put a ' \\' at the end of line.
